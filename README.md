## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where the players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The objective of this Java implementation is to provide a simple and interactive gaming experience.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to mark an empty space with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
- If all spaces are filled, and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
